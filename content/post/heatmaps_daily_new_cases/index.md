**Over the past weekend, I created an interactive COVID-19 Canada Testing Data Dashboard using Flexdashboard, Rmarkdown and Shiny. The dashboard is now [online](https://kuan-liu.shinyapps.io/Testing_Dash/).**

Data used in this dashboard are from the [COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group](https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada) and [Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/).
