This is work is produced by replicating the subnational analysis on temporal estimation of R0 provided at <https://epiforecasts.io/covid/> by a team of researchers lead by [Prof. Sebastian Funk](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/funk.sebastian) at the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Two R packages developed by the same team were used, the EpiNow R package and the EpiSoon R package. In addition, the forecastHybrid R package developed by David Shaub and Peter Ellis is used to produce a 14-day forecast on R0. Canada data is extracted again from the open-access data provided by the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group.

Complete results are shared at <https://kuan-liu.github.io/>. I plan to update estimation results about three times per week.
