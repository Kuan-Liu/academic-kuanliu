**Over the past weekend, I created an interactive COVID-19 Canada Data Dashboard using Flexdashboard, Rmarkdown and Shiny. The dashboard is now [online](https://kuan-liu.shinyapps.io/canada_dash/).**

Canada data used in this dashoard are extracted directly from the online data spreadsheet posted by [the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group](https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada) and the US data as well as UK, SK data are accessed through the [coronavirus R package](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) developed by [Rami Krispin](https://github.com/RamiKrispin). Rami is also my code source for building this dashboard. I used Rami's COVID-19 Italy dashboard source code as template, you can view his code at <https://github.com/RamiKrispin/italy_dash>.
