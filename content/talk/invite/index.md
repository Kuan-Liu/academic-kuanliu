**Highlighted Study Results**
- Young adults (20-24 years of age), male sex, single and actively-employed are associated with higher probability of being a current cannabis user
- Adults (25-64 year of age) and not actively-employed are associated with higher probability of being a current smoker
- Greater provincial variation on cannabis consumption compared to tobacco consumption (both statistically significant).
- Factors likely contributing to geo-variation:
    - Demographic differences
    - Jurisdiction-level policy and infrastructure differences

**Suggested policy implementations**
- Allocation of funds and resources of cannabis consumption related health promotion and prevention programs at hospital, community centre and primary care level
- Strategic licensing of cannabis retailers based on location of demand to increase potential taxation revenue
- Restrict youth consumption through implementing educational programs at school level and public area smoking restrictions
- Policy-making should consider geographic prevalence of consumption as well as user profiles
